title: 'Jupiler festival season 2018'
---

After three very successful years with the mechanical bull, Jupiler asked us to make a new design for the festival activations that connects in with Jupiler's new CCI "meer heb je niet nodig‚Äù (you don't need anything else).
We created 6 different units that will be used to build a unique setup suited for every festival.
shelters
the gate 
logo towers 
seating/stage elements 
fire pit
beertap motorcycle 

_In collaboration with Wink_
