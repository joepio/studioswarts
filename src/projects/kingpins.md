title: "Kingpins Amsterdam"
---

Kingpins Amsterdam is an invite-only denim sourcing show open to denim designers and buyers two times a year. The exhibitors are denim suppliers from all over the world.
In the trade show we created balance of infrastructure by using the shape of the building. The booth has limitations so all exhibitors have the same opportunities as their neighbour. Therefore, only their product makes the difference.
