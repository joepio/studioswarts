title: "Budweiser BUDX MIAMI"
---

For the 49th Superbowl we created the unique BUDX MIAMI weekend event by bringing 200 selfmade creatives from over 20 different countries together in a fully take over hotel. Every corner of the hotel contained a different activity, from screen printing with Daily Paper, to an art gallery from Shoe or a photoshoot in the BudX studio. For 3 unforgettable days creatives performed and partied alongside names such as Halsey, The Black Eyed Peas, Diplo, De la Soul and Channel Tres. Creating lasting memories of an unforgettable event and colouring Instagram Budweiser red!
